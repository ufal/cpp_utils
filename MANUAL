UFAL C++ Utils Files
====================

Most of the following files are used as headers only, with methods defined
inline where possible.

For more detailed documentation, see the header files.


binary_decoder.h
----------------

The binary_decoder class allows deserialization of data encoded using
binary_encoder.  The serialization is performed using a memory dump, so only
basic value types are supported.


binary_encoder.h
----------------

The binary_encoder class allows serialization of data, which can be deserialized
using binary_decoder.  The serialization is performed using a memory dump, so
only basic value types are supported.


compressor.h
------------

The compressor class allow uncompressing and compressing content of
binary_decoder and binary_encoder. LZMA compression is used.

To use compressor::load method, link the compressor_load.cpp file. To use
compressor::save method, link the compressor_save.cpp file.


iostreams.h
-----------

The iostreams.h file contains methods for various initializations of C++
iostreams and for loading a whole paragraph from istream.


iostreams_xml.h
---------------

Using the xml_encoded class, content of a string_piece can be appended to an
ostream, while encoding <>& and optionally " using XML entities.


named_values.h
--------------

The named_values class allows parsing of several named values into a map. The
format of the named values is the following:
- the values are semicolon separated
- every value has name=value format
- the value can be encoded using one of the following:
  - file:file_name: content of the given file name
  - data:length:value: the value is exactly length bytes and can include a
    semicolon
  - value: semicolon-separated value -


new_unique_ptr.h
----------------

The new_unique_ptr method creates a new instance of unique_ptr<T>, forwarding
all its argument to T constructor.


options.h
---------

The options class allow parsing options. For option can take either no value,
any value, or a specific set of values.

To use the options class, link options.cpp file.


parse_double.h
--------------

The parse_double methods parse a double.


parse_int.h
-----------

The parse_int methods parse a int.


pointer_decoder.h
-----------------

The pointer_decoder class has the same deserializing functionality as the
binary_decoder class, but deserializes non-owning data.


process_args.h
--------------

Using process_args and process_args_with_output_template methods, the given
processor is called on all specified input and output files. The two methods
differ in how they derive the name of the output file.
- process_args: The output file has to be specified after colon, for every
  input file separately.
- process_args_with_output_template: The output file name is generated using
  output template. The output template can contain {}, which is replaced by the
  base name of the input file (without directories and extension).


split.h
-------

The split methods can split string or string_piece to a vector of tokens
delimited by a specified delimiter character.


string_piece.h
--------------

The string_piece structure holds a non-owning reference to a string of specified
length.


threadsafe_stack.h
------------------

The threadsafe_stack class implements a simple stack with push and pop methods,
which are thread-safe and implemented using lock-free operations.


url_detector.h
--------------

The url_detector class allow recognizing URLs and emails. Either the whole given
string must match, or only its prefix.

To use the url_detector class, link url_detector.cpp file.
